This web application is a part of an online course by Harvard University.

This project is called Pinocchio Pizza and Subs. It is a restaurant’s online service. Users are able to browse the restaurant’s menu, add items to their cart, and submit their orders. Meanwhile, the restaurant owners are able to add and update menu items, and view orders that have been placed.

## Features
-   Register
-   Login
- Add items to shopping cart
- Remove items from shopping cart
- Placing orders

## Technologies

-  JavaScript
-  Python
-  Django
- SQL
-  HTML

## Project Requirements

-   **Menu**: Your web application should support all of the available menu items for  [Pinnochio’s Pizza & Subs](http://www.pinocchiospizza.net/menu.html)  (a popular pizza place in Cambridge). It’s up to you, based on analyzing the menu and the various types of possible ordered items (small vs. large, toppings, additions, etc.) to decide how to construct your models to best represent the information.
-   **Adding Items**: Using Django Admin, site administrators (restaurant owners) should be able to add, update, and remove items on the menu.
-   **Registration, Login, Logout**: Site users (customers) should be able to register for your web application with a username, password, first name, last name, and email address. Customers should then be able to log in and log out of your website.
-   **Shopping Cart**: Once logged in, users should see a representation of the restaurant’s menu, where they can add items (along with toppings or extras, if appropriate) to their virtual “shopping cart.” The contents of the shopping should be saved even if a user closes the window, or logs out and logs back in again.
-   **Placing an Order**: Once there is at least one item in a user’s shopping cart, they should be able to place an order, whereby the user is asked to confirm the items in the shopping cart, and the total (no need to worry about tax!) before placing an order.
-   **Viewing Orders**: Site administrators should have access to a page where they can view any orders that have already been placed.
